            As a Full-Time UX Engineer at GoTo Inc., I excelled in using HTML,

            rebranding initiative to transition to the GoTo brand. Throughout
            these tasks, I effectively employed tools such as grunt, gulp,
            bower, npm, and webpack to streamline development processes.
